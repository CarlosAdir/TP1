# Hotels' System

## Objective

This repository contains a hotels' system to make reservations of rooms and users.
The motivation of doing this system is for a subject in **Programming Techniques 1** in **Universidade de Bras√≠lia** to learn concepts about

* Object Oriented Programming (POO) in ```C++```
* How to make a Software architecture 
* Make separated modules to:
	- Separate scopes and respect privacy of each part
    - Be collaborative, more than one person can code and test
	- Test each class and file separately
    - Make it easier to debug and do the code maintenance
* Code test cases and classes
* Use abstract class as interface between modules
* Document using [Doxygen][doxygen_website]

## How to use

I recommend you to use a Linux with the compiler ```g++``` installed to run it.
There is a ```makefile``` inside the folder ```src/```.
So, to use it, just go inside the folder ```src/``` and type ```make``` in the terminal.
